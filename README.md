# Data Science Salaries

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to data science salaries between the years 2020 and 2022. The project aims to provide insights into average salaries based on experience levels and employment types, distribution of data science companies by size and location, top employee residence locations, and a geographic visualization of average salaries by country.

This project was part of my assignment in my Data Science class. Checkout my essay paper about the assigment:

### Discussion (recap)
- Firstly, there is a moderately strong positive relationship (correlation value of 
0.767433) between the geographical location of a company and the location of 
employee residences. This suggests that employees generally tend to live closer to their 
workplace, possibly for reasons such as convenience, reduced commuting time, or a 
better work-life balance. This finding has practical implications for employers in terms 
of determining the location of their company and considering factors such as housing 
affordability and transportation options to attract and retain talent. For employees, 
living near the company's location can lead to reduced commuting stress and expenses, 
allowing for improved time management and work-life balance.
- Secondly, there is a moderate positive relationship (correlation value of 0.4742) 
between company size and work experience. This indicates that individuals tend to 
accumulate more work experience as they work for larger companies. This 
understanding is valuable for employers in assessing the level of experience and 
expertise candidates may bring based on their previous employment in companies of 
different sizes. It also highlights the potential career growth opportunities associated 
with working for larger organizations, offering diverse and challenging roles for 
individuals to gain valuable experience and skills.
- Lastly, there is a weak positive relationship (correlation value of 0.19238) between 
salary and job title. On average, higher job titles tend to have slightly higher salaries. 
However, job title alone is not a strong determinant of salary. Employers should
consider additional factors such as experience, education, skills, and industry when 
determining salary levels. Employees should also focus on showcasing their 
experience, skills, and achievements during salary negotiations, while continuously 
developing their professional skills to increase their market value and potential for 
higher salaries.

Understanding these relationships provides insights for employers and employees alike. 
Employers can make informed decisions regarding company location, hiring strategies, and 
compensation practices. Employees can better navigate their career paths, negotiate salaries, 
and focus on professional development. Overall, these relationships contribute to creating 
conducive work environments, attracting and retaining talent, and fostering individual career 
growth and satisfaction [6].
